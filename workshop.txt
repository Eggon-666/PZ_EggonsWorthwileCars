title=Eggon's Worthwile Cars (build 41)
description=This mod modifies cars in three ways:
description=1) Trunks' capacity does not decrease when damaged.
description=2) Trunks' capacity increases proportionally to car size ranging from 25 (Chavalier Dart) to 300 (Chevalier Step Van).
description=3) Car loundess increases with car size (type has an effect too) from lowest (Chavalier Dart) to highest (Chevalier Step Van & Chevalier Cosette).
description=- see one of mod's screens for details of the capacity/loudness combination for each car.
description=
description=[b]Additional flavors:[/b]
description=* Ambulance and radio van have decreased capacity, as they served with pre-installed equipment.
description=* Station Wagon has excellent loudness to capacity ratio, it comes at a price of low engine power. It is sluggish and you should avoid driving it offroad especially when having the "Sunday Driver" trait.
description=* Pickups and pickup vans have increased engine power – perfect for trailers towing!
description=
description=[b]Vehicles loudness comparing to vanilla[/b]
description=Range of cars' loudness is the same as in vanilla, however it is allocated differently to various cars. Some cars are louder, some more silent than in vanilla (most cars are slighlty more silent).

description=- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2621971863]Refrigerated Spiffo Van Trunk[/url] - this mod will overwrite EWC's capacity increase and loudness tweak. EWC should still prevent capacity loss on damage.

description=Please let me know if you identify any compatibility issues. This mod overwrites vanilla vehicles definitions and therefore will not work with other mods that do the same. It should work with mods that eg. add vehicles and don't modify existing ones (but will not impact those added cars obviously) and mods not affecting vehicles.

description=[b]Adding to existing saves[/b]
description=I was able to add the mod to existing save and it did not crash, but do not take it for granted, there is a risk. However, if you add the mod to existing save, please bear in mind that it will not affect already spawned vehicles. You would need to travel to a cell that you have not visited before in order to get a car with upgraded properties.
